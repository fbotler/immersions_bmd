An immersion of a graph H in a graph G is a subgraph I of G for which there is an injection i : V(H) -> V(I) and a set of edge-disjoint paths {P_e : e \in E(H)} such that the end vertices of P_{uv} are precisely i(u) and i(v). The immersion analog of Hadwiger's Conjecture, posed by Lescure and Meyniel [On a problem upon configurations contained in graphs with given chromatic number, graph theory in memory of ga dirac (sandbjerg, 1985), 325–331. Ann. Discrete Math, 41.], says that every graph G contains an immersion of K_{\chi(G)}. Its restriction to graphs with independence number 2 is equivalent to Vergara's Conjecture [Complete graph immersions in dense graphs. Discrete Mathematics, 340(5):1019–1027, 2017.], that states that every graph with n vertices and independence number 2 has an immersion of K_{n/2}, has received some attention recently. In this paper we verify Vergara's Conjecture for graphs with bounded maximum degree. More specifically, we prove that if G is a graph with n vertices, independence number 2, and maximum degree less than 19n/29 - 1, then G contains an immersion of K_{n/2}.
